“Hey There” is a 1:1 React Native messenger application library where people can chat with those who are in a 1 km radius.


“Hey There” have the following screens: 
1. Map screen
2. Chat screen

Map screen where users can see other users who are within a 1km range. Markers represent users on the screen. If you can add a radius ﬁlter to ﬁlter the users that would be excellent.

The user will select the other user on the map and engage in the chat screen.

Functions or methods need to be provided for react native to inject users and send and receive messages
